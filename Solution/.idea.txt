# Brute force approach : 
1) Input Startcity
2) Remove that city from predefined citylist 
3) Generate all possible path ny permuatations
4) Calculate all path's cost 
5) Select the path or paths with minimum cost

# Nearest neighbour approach
1) Input Startcity
2) Iterate column vise in each city .
3) Every iteration will have minimum value of cost , according it's index append that in valuelist and indexlist respectively.
4) Next iteration should avoid previous value and index .
